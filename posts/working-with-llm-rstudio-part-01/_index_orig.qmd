## Exploration of Using Large Language Model Tools in R Studio

Part 1 of exploring integration of LLM tools into R Studio for more efficient data analysis and faster speed to insights.

-   Copilot

### Github Copilot

Copilot is pretty much a must-have to help with your coding, imo. That is, of course, as long as you're willing to pay for it, since it **requires a Copilot subscription**.

Posit has a [GitHub Copilot guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/tools/copilot.html) that gives you pretty much everything you need to get going.

-   easy integratiion with RStudio via **Tools \> Global Options**.
-   real-time code suggestions -\> way beyond traditional autocomplete offers.
-   suggestions can even provide good practices for coding efficiency or other techniques that you may not be aware of.

```{r}
#here()
data <- read_csv('data/lmr-data.csv')
#data <- read_csv('lmr-data.csv')
#data <- read_csv('lmr-data.csv')
# q: how is ARIMA used for time-series modeling?


Your request doesn't specify a task for me to execute and format for a .qmd file. Please provide the specific task you'd like me to complete.

### gptstudio

```{r}
library(gptstudio)
```

#### Addin: Chat

-   real-time prompting in Viewer pane with text responses
-   provides code suggestions based on prompts that you can then copy/paste into your R file
-   doesn't have visibility into your code in your R file
-   clunky interface in Viewer pane

```{}
```

```{r}

```
