## Highlights

(Quarters based on BC LDB fiscal yr Apr-Mar: Q1=Apr, May, Jun. Period is 2015-2023)

-   BC liquor sales revenue (\$) is strongest in Q2 (Jul-Sep of the fiscal yr) and Q3 (Oct-Dec), with generally steep drop-off in Q4 (Jan-Mar) and increase during Q1 (Apr-Jun).
-   Litre sales have a strong peak in Q2, driven by summer time beer volumes, whereas consumption shifts toward spirts and wine during holiday season.

## Intro

This is a continuation of a previous analysis of [annual liquor sales in British Columbia](../bc-liquor-market-review-2023-06-pt01-annual-trends), based on data from **British Columbia Liquor Distribution Board** '[**Liquor Market Review**](https://www.bcldb.com/publications/liquor-market-review)'. The Liquor Market Review is released on a quarterly basis, covering dollar and litre sales across major categories of **beer**, **wine**, **spirits**, and **'refreshment beverages'** (ciders, coolers).

While the previous analysis compared year-over-year data, the focus here is on **patterns in data based on quarter of year**, such as typical **peaks and valleys throughout the year**, including differences by major beverage type.

Data goes back to 2015 (BC LDB Fiscal Year 2016, since fiscal yr ends in March).

**As mentioned in previous article:** *my expertise is in data analysis, not the liquor industry, so the emphasis is on exploring what the data can tell us. Industry-insider context may be lacking. In the interest of promoting data analysis and learning, I am sharing most of the R code used to process the data - hence the expandable 'Code' options.*

## Stats by Quarter of the Year

### Overview

We'll start with an overview across all beverage types and then look at trends for beverage types further down below.

```{r, calc_qtr}
# roll-up categories by qtr
trend_ttl_qtr <- lmr_data %>% group_by(year, fyr, fy_qtr, qtr) %>% summarize(
  netsales=sum(netsales),
  litres=sum(litres)
)
# calculate quarterly info
trend_qtr <- lmr_data %>% group_by(fy_qtr, start_qtr_dt, qtr) %>% 
  summarize(netsales=sum(netsales),
            litres=sum(litres)
            )

trend_qtr <- trend_qtr %>% ungroup() %>% mutate(
            pc_chg_sales=netsales/lag(netsales)-1,
            pc_chg_litres=litres/lag(litres)-1,
            pc_chg_sales_qtr=netsales/lag(netsales, n=4),
            pc_chg_litres_qtr=litres/lag(litres, n=4)
)
# averages
trend_qtrs <- trend_qtr %>% group_by(qtr) %>% summarize(
  avgsales=mean(netsales),
  avglitres=mean(litres),
  avg_sales_pc_chg=mean(pc_chg_sales, na.rm=TRUE),
  avg_litres_pc_chg=mean(pc_chg_litres, na.rm=TRUE)
)
```

#### \$ Sales

Overlay of \$ sales data for quarter of each year to see overall trends:

-   sales are mostly even in Q2 (Jul-Aug-Sep) and Q3 (Oct-Nov-Dec), covering most of the summer and the Christmas holiday season.
-   Q4 (Jan-Feb-Mar) by far the slowest period.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: BC LDB fiscal yr end Mar 31, so Q1=Apr-May-Jun, and so on; black line = average.
ch_title <- "$ Sales Comparison by Quarter (fiscal yr end Mar 31)"
plot <- trend_ttl_qtr %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=netsales, color=factor(fyr), group=fyr))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(data=trend_qtrs, aes(x=qtr, y=avgsales, group=1), color='black', linewidth=1.5)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma(scale=1e-6, prefix="$", suffix="M"), expand=expansion(add=c(0,0.1)), limits=c(0,max(trend_ttl_qtr$netsales)))+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="", y="Net $ Sales", color='fiscal yr')
ggplotly(plot)
  
```

The drop from Q3 to Q4 is the only consistent pattern across the years looked at. Relative level of sales between Q1-Q2 and Q2-Q3 varies from year to year.

Looking at patterns in % change between quarters confirms that either ends of the fiscal yr have the biggest changes:

-   Q4 has a consistently large drop from previous quarter and Q1 has consistently big increase from previous quarter.
-   Q2 tends to show positive growth over Q1, but not always. Q3 straddles 0% change from previous.

```{r}
ch_title <- "Distribution of % Change in $ Sales Between Quarters"
plot <- trend_qtr %>% ggplot(aes(y=pc_chg_sales, x=qtr))+
  geom_boxplot(fill=bar_col)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format())+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype='dotted')+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="",y="% chg from prev quarter")
ggplotly(plot)
```

The middle black line represents median for each quarter, with the colored area representing the range from 25% of the time to 75% of the time (1st & 3rd quartiles).

#### Litres

Overlaying litres sold by quarter for each year shows volume changes throughout the year:

-   Q2 (Jul-Aug-Sep) has highest sales, edging out Q1 (Apr-May-Jun)
-   Q3 (Oct-Nov-Dec) sees drop, even with holidays, and then lower again for Q4 (Jan-Feb-Mar)

```{r}
#| fig-cap: BC LDB fiscal yr ends Mar 31
ch_title <- "Litres Comparison by Quarter (fiscal yr end Mar 31)"
plot <- trend_ttl_qtr %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=litres, color=factor(fyr), group=fyr))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(data=trend_qtrs, aes(x=qtr, y=avglitres, group=1), color='black', size=1.5)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma(scale=1e-6, suffix="M"), expand=expansion(add=c(0,0.1)), limits=c(0,max(trend_ttl_qtr$litres)))+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="", y="litres", color='fiscal yr')
ggplotly(plot)
  
```

The different pattern compared to \$ sales likely represents the shift in drinking habits with the seasons:

-   peak volume (litres) is in Q2 - beer season, and beer, along with refreshment beverages, are consumer in higher volumes than the other types.
-   Q3, which is usually even with Q2 in \$ sales, has a consistent drop in litre volume compared to Q2, due to shift away from beer/refreshments beverages toward wine and spirits.

Patterns by beverage type are looked at more below.

Percentage changes from one quarter to the next reflect the different quarter-by-quarter patterns for litres.

```{r}
ch_title <- "Distribution of % Change in Litres Between Quarters"
plot <- trend_qtr %>% ggplot(aes(y=pc_chg_litres, x=qtr))+
  geom_boxplot(fill=bar_col)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format())+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype='dotted')+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="",y="% chg from prev quarter")
ggplotly(plot)
```

-   Q1 (Apr-May-Jun) typically has around 35% increase over previous Q4
-   Q2 (Jul-Aug-Sep) tends to be even or slight increase over Q1.
-   Q3 (Oct-Nov-Dec) big drop around 15% range compared to Q2.
-   Q4 (Jan-Feb-Mar) usually another \~15% from Q3 to Q4.

### By Major Beverage Type

Let's look at beverage types to see what is going on below the surface of overall trends.

```{r}
# quarters at cat_type level
trend_qtr_cat <- lmr_data %>% group_by(year, fyr, fy_qtr, start_qtr_dt, qtr, type) %>%
  summarize(netsales=sum(netsales),
            litres=sum(litres)
            )
trend_qtr_cat$type <- as.factor(trend_qtr_cat$type)

trend_qtrs_cat <- trend_qtr_cat %>% group_by(qtr, type) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_netsales=mean(netsales),
    avg_litres=mean(litres),
    max_litres=max(litres)
  )
trend_qtrs_cat <- trend_qtrs_cat %>% group_by(qtr) %>% mutate(
  avg_netsales_pc=avg_netsales/sum(avg_netsales),
  avg_litre_pc=avg_litres/sum(avg_litres)
)
trend_qtrs_cat$type <- as.factor(trend_qtrs_cat$type)
```

#### \$ Sales

Looking at quarter sales by beverage type reveals patterns we suspected earlier:

-   **Beer and refreshment beverages tend to peak in Q2** and decline in Q3 and Q4.
-   **Wine and, especially, spirits peak in Q3** and offset the decline in revenue from beer and refreshment beverages.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "black line = average"
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: center
ch_title <- "Comparison of Qtrly $ Sales by Beverage Type"
trend_qtr_cat %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=netsales, color=factor(fyr), group=fyr))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(data=trend_qtrs_cat, aes(x=qtr, y=avg_netsales), color='black', group=1, size=1.2)+
  facet_grid(type~., scales='free_y')+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma(scale=1e-6, prefix="$", suffix="M"), 
                     limits=c(0,NA))+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="", color="fiscal yr", y="$ Sales (upper limit varies)")+
  theme(panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA))
```

Stacked chart highlights the shifts between Q2 and Q3:

-   decline in \$ sales of Beer and Refreshment Beverages in Q3 almost completely offset by increase in wine and spirits.

```{r}
trend_qtrs_cat$type <- fct_reorder(trend_qtrs_cat$type, trend_qtrs_cat$avg_netsales)

ch_title <- "$ Sales by Type"
plot <- trend_qtrs_cat %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=avg_netsales, fill=type))+
  #geom_col(position='fill')+
  geom_col()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma(scale=1e-6, prefix="$", suffix="M"), 
                     expand=expansion(add=c(0,0.1)))+
  scale_fill_manual(values=type_color)+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="",y="Avg Net Sales in Qtr (2015-2023)")+
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_text(size=9))
p1_plotly <- ggplotly(plot) %>% layout(margin=list(l=110, r=0), showlegend=TRUE,
                                       legend=list(x=-1, y=0.6, xanchor='left', 
                                                   yanchor='middle'))

ch_title <- "% $ Sales by Type"
plot_f <- trend_qtrs_cat %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=avg_netsales, fill=type))+
  geom_col(position='fill')+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format(), expand=expansion(add=c(0,0)))+
  scale_fill_manual(values=type_color)+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="",y="Avg % Net Sales in Qtr (2015-2023)")+
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y=element_text(size=9))
p2_plotly <- ggplotly(plot_f) %>% layout(margin=list(l=60, r=0), showlegend=FALSE)
# grid.arrange doesn't work with plotly; plotly has subplot, but couldn't get right layout
manipulateWidget::combineWidgets(p1_plotly, p2_plotly, nrow=1, colsize = c(3,2))

```

#### Litres

Similar quarter-over-quarter patterns can be seen when looking at litres sold, although the overall differences from one quarter to the next - especially Q2 to Q3 - are larger when measured in litres, since Beer and Refreshment Beverages are consumed in larger quantities than Wine and Spirits.

```{r}
#| fig-width: 5
#| fig-height: 6
#| fig-align: center
ch_title <- "Comparison of Qtrly volume by Category"
trend_qtr_cat %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=litres, color=factor(fyr), group=fyr))+
  geom_line()+
  geom_point()+
  facet_grid(type~., scales='free_y')+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma(scale=1e-6, suffix="M"), 
                     limits=c(0,NA))+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="", color="fiscal yr", y="litres (upper limit varies)")+theme(panel.border = element_rect(fill=NA))
  #+ theme(panel.border = element_line())
```

-   Beer and, even more-so, refreshment beverages drop from Q1-Q2 (Apr-Sep) to Q3-Q4 (Oct-Mar).
-   Wine, Spirits have small peak in Q3 (Oct-Dec) - holiday season.

This pattern shows up clearly when looking at the average % breakdown in litres by beverage type (chart on right):

```{r}
trend_qtrs_cat$type <- fct_reorder(trend_qtrs_cat$type, trend_qtrs_cat$avg_litres)

ch_title <- "Avg Litres by Type"
plot <- trend_qtrs_cat %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=avg_litres, fill=type))+
  geom_col()+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=label_comma(scale=1e-6, suffix="M"), 
                     expand=expansion(mult = c(0,0)))+
  scale_fill_manual(values=type_color)+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="",y="Average Litres by Quarter (2015-2023)")+
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=9),
        legend.position = 'none')
plotly_1 <- ggplotly(plot)

ch_title <- "Avg Litre % by Type"
plot <- trend_qtrs_cat %>% ggplot(aes(x=qtr, y=round(avg_litre_pc,2), fill=type))+
  geom_col(position='fill')+
  scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format(), expand=expansion(mult = c(0,0)))+
  scale_fill_manual(values=type_color)+
  labs(title=ch_title, x="",y="Average % Share by Quarter (2015-2023)")+
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size=9),
        legend.position = 'right')
plotly_2 <- ggplotly(plot)
combineWidgets(plotly_1, plotly_2, nrow=1, colsize = c(3,5))

```

Chart on right highlights the bulge in % litre share for Wine in Q3 (Sep-Dec), an increase from 15% in previous quarter to 20% in Q3. Spirts likewise have strong increase from 6% in Q2 to 8% in Q3. These shifts in share come at the expense largely of Refreshment Beverages - dropping from 16% in Q2 to 11% in Q3 - and Beer, to a lesser extent, down only 2%. It seems refreshment beverage drinkers are somewhat fickle and maybe make choices based on the season.

### Part 2 Wrap-up and Next Up

This concludes our look at quarter patterns, including quarters from mid-2015 to mid-2023.

#### Next-up:

1.  **Category trends and patterns:** closer look at each of the major beverage types, exploring categories and sub-categories within them, as reported in the Liquor Market Review.
2.  **Category 1: Beer:** start with beer, because...beer. ;)

### Footnotes

Notes on 'net \$ sales':

-   the report says "**Net dollar value is based on the price paid by the customer** and excludes any applicable taxes."
-   calculating average **net dollar value per litre for beverage categories gives unrealistically low numbers** compared to retail prices in BC liquor stores. (*Beer at average \$4/litre? Not even the cheapest beer on the [BC Liquor Stores](https://www.bcliquorstores.com/product-catalogue?category=beer&sort=currentPrice:desc&page=1) website.*)
-   there is likely additional factors related to BC LDB pricing structure, wholesaling, etc.
-   best to **consider average net dollar value per litre referred to below as relative indicator**.
